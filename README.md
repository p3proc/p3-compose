# p3-compose
A graphical pipeline builder for p3 in electron

This is a work-in-progress and does not work yet...

## How-to-setup
Clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies necessary for running in a folder called
"node_modules".

## How-to-use

To start the app, run:

```
npm start
```

This will run the `start` directive in the `package.json` file, which
first builds the js files with webpack, then runs the electron entrypoint.
